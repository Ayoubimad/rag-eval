# Comparative Analysis of RAG Components: Chunking Strategies, Retrieval Methods, and Evaluation Metrics

Thesis Project on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems

## Abstract

This research project presents a comprehensive empirical study of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, focusing on three critical components:
1. Document chunking strategies and their impact on retrieval effectiveness
2. Comparative analysis of retrieval methodologies
3. Chunking enrichment strategies and their impact on retrieval effectiveness

### Chunking strategies:
