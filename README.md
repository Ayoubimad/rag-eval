# Comparative Analysis of RAG Components: Chunking Strategies, Retrieval Methods, and Evaluation Metrics

Master Thesis Project on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems

## Abstract

This research project presents a comprehensive empirical study of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, focusing on three critical components:
1. Document chunking strategies and their impact on retrieval effectiveness
2. Comparative analysis of retrieval methodologies
3. Systematic evaluation of RAG pipeline performance using state-of-the-art metrics

The study aims to provide empirical evidence for optimal RAG system configuration and contribute to the broader understanding of information retrieval in language model augmentation.

## Research Objectives

- Evaluate and compare different document chunking strategies:
  - Fixed-size chunking
  - Semantic-based segmentation
  - Hybrid approaches
  - Impact on context preservation and retrieval quality

- Analyze retrieval methods:
  - Dense retrievers (e.g., embedding-based)
  - Sparse retrievers (e.g., BM25, TF-IDF)
  - Hybrid retrieval approaches
  - Performance characteristics under various conditions

- Assess RAG system evaluation methodologies:
  - Implementation of RAGAS metrics suite
  - Integration with R2R (SOTA production ready RAG framework)
  - Cross-comparison of evaluation approaches
